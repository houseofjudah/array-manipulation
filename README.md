Testing Explanation

To test the functions,


we first log the original students array to the console.
Then, we filter the students by grade A and grade B and log the resulting arrays to the console.
We also calculate the average age of all students and students with grade A and log the results to the console.
By running this code
we can verify that the filterByGrade function correctly filters the students by grade and that the averageAge function correctly
calculates the average age of the students.`
